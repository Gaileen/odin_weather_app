# odin_weather_app
The weather app assignment in Odin's JS course.

Current status - required functionality is finished.
Just need to restyle:
    1. Reformat weather text.
    2. Dates (display the day and bold it).
    3. Generate different smiskis for each day container.
    4. Reformat search bar/button coloring.
